<h2>THE INFLUENCE OF THE</h2>
<h2>ORGAN IN HISTORY.</h2>


<h3>SECTION I.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It having become my duty to deliver this, the inaugural
lecture of the organ department attached to
this institution, I have found myself considerably embarrassed
as to choice of subjects.</p>

<p>The trouble lay in the quantity of material at hand,
and not in any lack of it.</p>

<p>The history of the Organ runs back so far into the
centuries, that no matter what point one might select
for examination, it can scarcely be brought into the
scope of a lecture except in a very empty and skeleton
form. You will bear with me, then, for the superficial
manner in which I shall be forced to treat many
important points. As many of those present do not
propose to make a study of the organ, I shall avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
treating of the instrument itself in any technical sense,
and would offer a few thoughts on the subject of</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Influence Of the Organ in History,</span></p>

<p>with a glance at the "schools of playing" thus created.</p>

<p>The Organ is called the "king of instruments."</p>

<p>This phrase has been used so often that it has become
decidedly well worn and trite. None the less, however,
is the expression full of significance; and to what an
extent (especially in a historical sense) is known to but
comparatively few persons, among whom I fear far too
few organists would be found.</p>

<p>To bring up some of these neglected facts; to examine
them in their historical and theoretical bearing, as well
as in practice; to thus create a greater love for and
appreciation of the instrument on the part of its students,&mdash;to
do this, I say, is, if I apprehend it aright,
one of the principal objects which the Boston University
has had in view in founding this department.</p>

<p>The organ, then, is called the "king of instruments."</p>

<p>If we look at the phrase a little closer, it will be
perceived that the simile is a striking one. A king, in
the so-called "good old times of yore," if he were a
man of any force of character, generally possessed,
along with the divine right theoretical, any quantity of
the human power practical. The day of more or less
ornamental constitutional figure-heads had not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>In other words, the live kings of the past, of the
feudal time, moulded to their own tastes and characters
their age, their people, or only their court, according to
the innate ability they might possess. In turn they
were themselves affected, to a degree, by their surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>ings,
but to a far lesser extent than is the case at this
day, the balance of influence remaining largely in their
favour.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to show that among musical instruments
this "kingship," as regards the organ, held good
in a parallel way,&mdash;that by its own nature as to construction,
by its very faults and weaknesses, by the
mission it was called upon to fulfil, it did, in very fact,
long reign supreme as king of instruments.</p>

<p>Absolute power, as represented by a monarch, became
narrowed down, in the lapse of centuries, by external
forces working out their own independence, thus checking
and limiting this absolutism. Here, too, I will
endeavour to draw a parallel, and show that as years
rolled on, the influence of the organ upon music in the
abstract diminished. The process became inverted, and
music began to affect the organ, rather than the organ
it. To this we owe the vast improvements in the construction
of the instrument, the many additions of new
qualities of tone, and numberless new inventions of
value still going on in our day, with a rapidity difficult
to keep pace with. To fairly appreciate this past or
present relation of things, it becomes necessary to take
a hasty and necessarily superficial glance backward at
the origin of the organ,&mdash;its invention and development.</p>

<p>All writers attribute the origin of the organ to that
simplest as well as most ancient of musical instruments,
called by the Greeks the "pipes of Pan,"&mdash;Pan, in
the ancient mythology, being the god of the woods
and groves. It consisted of a few hollow reeds of
various lengths, securely bound together, and blown
by the lips. We still occasionally see and hear this
instrument in our streets, performed upon by those
nomadic "sons of art," the organ-grinders. The per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>former
being obliged to move his head continually from
side to side, an unpleasant and fatiguing operation,
soon led to an attempt to blow these tubes artificially.
From this resulted the placing of the pipes upon a
small wind-chest, and the addition of a primitive
bellows, the whole being easily carried and operated by
one performer. Of particular value in the establishment
of this historical fact was the discovery, in Syria,
among some ancient ruins, of a sculptured figure
playing on such an instrument. Although much mutilated,
all the more important parts were still intact.
This interesting relic was brought to England about
the year 1853.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned here, that the word "organ,"
not unfrequently found in the Bible, should not be
supposed to refer to any such instrument as the name
would suggest to our minds. Both with the Greeks
and Romans the term translated "organ" simply
meant an "instrument,"&mdash;and that of any kind, but
with usage apparently favouring its application to
musical instruments.</p>

<p>Upon the application of the bellows to supply wind,
instead of the human lungs, the fingers were used to
stop the pipes, and thus prevent their sounding all at
once, which it is evident they would have done, standing
on a simple wind-chest, which was filled by the
bellows. As the number of pipes was gradually increased,
the difficulty of managing them by hand of
course became greater and greater. This in time led
to the invention of the pallet, or valve, to control the
admission of wind to each pipe, and by the close of
the eleventh century we find it chronicled that there
existed at Magdeburg an organ with a <i>key-board</i> comprising
sixteen keys. From this time the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
instrument begins to correspond with our modern idea
of the same; its invention was a realized fact, although
but a germ of that development which has since raised
organ-building to its artistic importance. It must be
borne in mind that the pedal organ, with its keys for
the feet, was a much later invention. Meantime, the
first keys made use of measured from three to five
inches and a half wide. Consequently, the title of the
performer on this instrument, in the eleventh century,
was not that of organ-<i>player</i>, but organ-<i>beater</i>, the
keys being struck by the fist, which was protected by a
heavy glove. There was, it must be remembered, but
one rank of pipes, and these could seldom, if ever, have
been in tune, from the fact that they had no means of
regulating the wind pressure; while in organs of later
date, and at the present day, an even wind is secured
principally by weights placed upon the bellows, and the
creation of a reservoir of compressed air. At this early
time the wind supply was furnished by the common
bellows as used by blacksmiths. Thus the supply and
consequent pressure of the wind would necessarily be in
direct proportion to the muscle or activity of the blowers.</p>

<p>While the various discoveries and improvements in
organs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were
slowly progressing, almost the only vocal music the
world knew were the Gregorian tones, or plain song of
the Early Church. Harmony was entirely unknown, and
indeed remained so for many a long year in anything
like our modern significance. It is not my purpose here
to enter into even a partial examination of the parallel
progress of melody and harmony at this age of the
world. You have already heard it treated by an abler
pen than mine; nor does it properly belong to this
department, except in so far as it becomes necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
note any decided influence exerted by the one upon the
other. This influence, as exerted by the organ upon
Church music, did not begin as early as might be supposed.
Rimbault, in his work on the "History of the
Organ" (which I shall have occasion frequently to
quote), states that "even in the thirteenth century, the
priests of both the Greek and Roman Churches thought
the use of organs in divine service scandalous and profane.
They preferred rendering divine worship as
simple as possible, in order to distinguish it from that
of the Jews and Pagans. Even to this day the Greek
Church does not tolerate the use of organs in their
public services. Notwithstanding these opinions, the
use of organs, and even other instruments, gradually
became almost universal, not only in great churches,
but in those of monasteries, convents, and small
towns. The historians of this era celebrate several
monks distinguished for the art of playing on the
organ. For some time, however, organs were not
used in the ordinary celebration of the offices, but only
on great feasts and solemn occasions. These first
monastic and conventual organs were very small, being
only used to play the melody of the plain song in unison
with the voices."</p>

<p>In spite of the disrepute into which the whole monastic
system fell, there is no question but that the monks
and friars were the great conservators and preservers
of all the fine arts, and even mechanics, during the
troubled times of the Middle Ages. As the prejudice
against the employment of instrumental music in the
church services began to disappear, nothing was more
natural than that the monks, having both the leisure
and pecuniary means, and containing among their
number the best educated men of the day, should turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
their attention to organ-building, animated by the same
spirit which led them to decorate and ornament their
churches and monasteries. Thus we find that it is to
them we owe the improvement of the hitherto clumsy
key-board, extending its compass both upward and
downward to the extent of some three octaves, and so
reduced both fall and breadth of the keys that they
could be pressed down by the fingers, instead of struck
by the fist; certainly no small improvement. The first
organ possessing keys to give the chromatic tones or
semitones was built by a priest&mdash;Nicholas Faber by
name&mdash;about 1360.</p>

<p>It now behoves us to glance for a moment at the
influence which the organ already began to exert upon
music, or the art composition, and to show how the
instrument became to show proofs of that right to the
title, "king of instruments," in the sense I have
adopted. It must be kept in mind that the veriest
twilight dawn of the knowledge of harmony had
scarcely begun. Yet what can be conceived more
natural, than that the organist of that day, even,
should stumble on the fact that different tones in conjunction
were more agreeable to the ear than the bare
unison, which was at first the only accompaniment of
the choral song? This being noted, the next logical
step was to try and produce the same approved effect
with the voices themselves. In the "<i>History of the
Modern Music of Western Europe</i>," by <i>Kiesewetter</i>,
the following passage occurs. He is not speaking of
the organ, but of the origin and development of the
science of harmony.</p>

<p>He says: "The union of different human voices
which now occurred to their thoughts (the early harmonists),
was an imitation not altogether happy, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>haps,
of that which in various instances <i>they had
discovered with the organ</i>!" Here the fact that the
organ was even then beginning to assert itself, to mould
the minds of the early writers, in fact, to claim its
royal dues, is pretty conclusively shown.</p>

<p>Time would altogether fail me in the scope that this
lecture must necessarily occupy, to trace down this
influence, once established, through the long cycle of
years that followed; the theoretic science and practical
application keeping pace with the mechanical development,
until it found its full culmination and glory in
the new-born science of Counterpoint. This science,
which has given polish to the mightiest thoughts of the
greatest masters of our art (and in totally different
departments than mere organ-playing),&mdash;a science,
without a satisfactory knowledge of which no man can
call himself a thoroughly educated musician,&mdash;sprang
from just this source.</p>

<p>How often we hear the remark that contrapuntal
treatment is best suited to the organ! True; but how
many reflect that the organ, so to speak, first <i>dictated</i>
counterpoint to the world? An influence, which (the
free forms being derived from the stricter) is carried
clear down into the realm of Italian opera, <i>i.e.</i>, when it
is good of its kind. Is not, then, this influence, which
the organ has indisputably exerted upon not merely its
own literature, but the musical literature at large, an
all-sufficient proof of its right to the royal title? It
must be borne in mind that this absolutism, as in
matters political (to carry out the simile), was possible
at this stage of the world in matters musical, because
not even the harpsichord, clavichord, spinet, or any of
those presentiments of the modern pianoforte, by whatever
name they were called, had as yet made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
appearance. The organ was, for the time, the sole
keyed instrument.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, it seems to me that it may be
justly claimed that the title "king of instruments"
should be based on far nobler and more historic grounds
than is usually done, and that we should not content
ourselves with explaining this phrase as arising from
the circumstances that it is the instrument which can,
of its own resources, make the loudest noise!</p>

<h3><a name="SECTION_II" id="SECTION_II"></a>SECTION II.</h3>


<p>The organ nomenclature has, as is the way of the world,
changed somewhat from age to age. In accounts of
the old English organ, we frequently find this and that
church being referred to as possessing a "payre of
organs." This has been variously interpreted, some
supposing it to refer to organs of two manuals, which
explanation seems natural enough; but the best
authorities explain it as meaning an organ which possesses
more than one rank of pipes, or more than one
stop. Rimbault, who takes this view, says the expression
is to be regarded as a phrase of nearly obsolete
English, and to be taken in the same sense as we still
sometimes say "a pair of stairs," instead of a "flight
of stairs." One proof of this interpretation that he
cites is interesting. During the great Cromwellian rebellion,
and the rule of the Roundheads in England, a
great many organs were destroyed by the soldiery, who
considered them a relic of Popery. At this time, a
certain Mr. Pepys, whose diary is still extant, travelled
about considerably and interested himself in the organ,
as well as some other matters, as will be seen from the
following extract from the aforesaid diary. The point
to us (although by no means the only one to him) lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in the fact that he uses the words "the organ" and the
"pair of organs" as evidently, synonymous. He writes
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>April 5, 1667. "<i>To Hackney: where good beef tongue,
and things to eat and drink, and very merry, the weather
being mighty pleasant; and here I was told, that at their
church they have a fair <span class="smcap">PAIR OF ORGANS</span>, which play while
the people sing, which I am mighty glad of wishing the like
at our church at London, and would give £50 towards it.</i>"</p>

<p>April 21, 1667. "<i>To Hackney church, where very full,
and found much difficulty to get pews. I offered the sexton
money, and he could not help me.... That which I
chiefly went to see was the young ladies of the schools,
whereof there is great store, very pretty" (you see how
history repeats itself); "and <span class="smcap">ALSO</span> the <span class="smcap">ORGAN</span>, which is
handsome and tunes the psalms, and plays with the
people; which is mighty pretty, and makes me mighty
earnest to have a pair at our church, I having almost a
mind to give them a pair, if they would settle a maintenance
on them for it.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Pepys' heart was evidently in the right place,
and the thought of having the church provide a fund
for the proper tuning and repair of the organ, not only
sensible, but, to quote his own words, "a mighty
pretty" idea.</p>

<p>The invention of the pedal key-board, that most
important and characteristic part of the organ, seems
to have occurred about the beginning of the fourteenth
century. There is no reliable account of who first made
this addition, it being claimed by various parties. The
sixteenth century was the period when the arts of sculpture,
painting, and architecture had gained what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
almost be termed a modern artistic polish, in not a few
instances, indeed, surpassing all that the moderns have
accomplished. The early school of church painters had
become modified. Grace and relative refinement had
largely taken the place of the early stiffness of design
and execution, and in sculpture and architecture were
witnessed many of the results which are still the wonder
of the world. With this refinement came a taste for
luxury and a love of ornament which in the seventeenth
and early part of the eighteenth century had extended
to and affected organ-building, at least externally.</p>

<p>Seidel, in his work on the organ, gives this excellent
account of the tendency referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At this time, great industry and expense was bestowed
upon the external decoration of the organ. The
entire case was ornamented with statues, heads of
angels, vases, foliage, and even figures of animals.
Sometimes the front pipes were painted with grotesque
figures, and the lips of the pipes made to resemble lions'
jaws. They went further, and threw away the money,
which might have been expended in a worthier manner,
on the display of the most tasteless and absurd tricks
of art, degrading thereby&mdash;doubtless unintentionally&mdash;a
noble instrument, intended for sacred purposes, into a
<i>raree-show</i>. Among these ornaments, the figures of
angels played a very conspicuous part; trumpets were
placed in their hands, which by means of mechanism
could be moved to and from the mouth. Carillons
(bells) too, and kettle-drums, were performed upon by
the movable arms of angels." (Think of an angel playing
upon a kettle-drum!). "In the midst of this heavenly
host, sometimes a gigantic angel would be exhibited
hovering in a 'glory' over the organ, beating time with
his bâton as conductor of this super-earthly orchestra!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Under such circumstances, the firmament, of course,
could not be dispensed with. So we had wandering
suns and moons, and jingling stars in motion. Even
the animal kingdom was summoned to activity. Cuckoos,
nightingales, and every species of bird, singing, or
rather chirping, glorified the festival of Christmas, and
announced to the assembled congregation the birth of
the Redeemer. Eagles flapped their wings, or flew towards
an artificial sun. The climax, however, of all
these rarities, was the <i>fox-tail</i>. It was intended to
frighten away from the organ all such inquisitive persons
as had no business near it. Thus, when they pulled
out this draw-stop, suddenly a large fox-tail flew into
their faces! It is clear that by such absurd practices,
curiosity was much rather excited than stopped, and
that all this host of moving figures, and their ridiculous
jingling, disturbed meditation, excited the curiosity of
the congregation, and thus disparaged the sublimity
of divine service."</p>

<p>Of course all this nonsense in due time brought its
own cure with it. The money expended was diverted
towards its worthy and legitimate object, and to-day,
in Europe, but few such relics of the past can be found,
and those generally in out-of-the-way places. I have
myself seen but one organ containing any of these absurdities.
That was in a small town of Camin, on the
Baltic sea-coast of North Prussia, and I was informed
by the old organist (as Seidel says) that these things
were <i>reserved for Christmas and Easter</i>!</p>

<p>While the power, compass, and variety of organ tone,
as well as the mechanism of the instrument, made
steady progress throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, the science of harmony in the largest sense
kept even pace with it, and, perhaps, received even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
greater relative development. Meantime, the orchestral
instruments of the day had received a fair share of
improvement. The harpsichord had been invented, and
sufficiently perfected to be worthy of the powers of such
a master as Sebastian Bach. With the appearance of
this great man the art of counterpoint reached its
culmination, never surpassed, if even equalled in isolated
instances, by any subsequent writer. His organ
compositions cover every resource, both in design and
execution, possible to the organ of his day; and yet, I
do not think it too much to say that, had Bach never
written a single organ piece, his claims for recognition
as a great composer would remain substantially the
same. His greatest works are to be found among his
vocal and orchestral writings. Let us examine for a
moment the reason for this, and of the influence of the
"king of instruments" upon musical composition at
this time.</p>

<p>We have seen that contrapuntal treatment, so-called,
owed its origin to the nature of the organ. Vocal
music, at the time of which we speak, felt the same
influence and followed the same form. Now, if we open
one of the vocal and orchestral scores of Bach, we shall
see that while he gives the instruments more freedom
than his predecessors, in consequence of their largely
increased powers and the proportional increased ability
of the executants of his day, yet the contrapuntal influence
is everywhere visible. It was the period of strict
form. As we count back such cycles, it was but a relatively
short time since music had been "without form,
and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep,"
artistically speaking. Music was a serious matter.
They revelled in fugue, and even danced contrapuntally.
Although not a direct influence, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
is not this state of things, after all, a sufficient proof
of the absolutism of the organ in a derived manner,&mdash;the
regal sway of the king of instruments at this
period? Bach breathed new life into these dry and
purely scientific forms, and it is his greatest glory that
in many, if not all, of his profoundest works, his genius
enabled him to unite the emotional and æsthetic element
with the purely intellectual and scientific.</p>

<p>While the improvement of the organ, as respects both
tone, mechanism and general capabilities, continued,
and still continues at the present day, it is noteworthy
that from the time of Bach, of all others, the influence
of the organ upon music at large began to diminish.
From this point we have to consider the decline of this
influence, showing that music began to emancipate
itself, each instrument claiming and receiving its own
especial rights and treatment, long before a similar
dawn of liberty began in the political world. Two
reasons conduced to this change.</p>

<p>First, the requirements of music, which found no
prototype in the organ of that day. As the instruments
were then built, they possessed but little variety of tone,
the swelling or diminishing of which was an impossibility;
nor had the organist any mechanical assistance
whatever to enable him to vary the combinations of stops.</p>

<p>Second, the invention of the harpsichord. This instrument,
the <i>avant-courier</i> of the pianoforte, to which
we have already referred, had already become sufficiently
popular to make its own peculiar influence felt.
This consisted in the power of crescendo and diminuendo
according to the force exerted by the player, and
a light touch which offered no impediment to rapid
execution, besides certain other effects through its characteristic
tone impossible upon the organ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The light touch of the harpsichord, as compared with
the heavy and fatiguing action of the organs of that
day, was necessarily a source of great attraction; and
the instrument itself, although far from finding a home
in every household, as the piano has in our time, yet
possessed the merit of being portable.</p>

<p>It was not long before the transition period began,&mdash;that
period in which musicians and composers tested
and decided upon that which was best and most fitting
in the treatment of these respective instruments.
Nowhere can we find more evident signs of this time of
experiment, this gradually leaving old landmarks and
seeking a new form of expression, than in the works of
Bach himself.</p>

<p>In the "Well-Tempered Clavier" we find preludes
and fugues impossible to properly interpret on any other
instrument except the piano, placed side by side with
those whose real significance can only be developed upon
the organ. In a portion of the pieces written especially
for the organ, we find, on the other hand, passages
which to modern ears are only fit for and tolerable on
the piano. The dividing lines of effect, not to say
possibility, had not as yet been fully marked out. The
organ was no more disposed to give up its long sway,
and be narrowed to its own particular sphere, than
any other sovereign, when the limiting influences of
modern times first began to make themselves felt. Like
them, however, it was obliged to yield. Little by little
the piano emancipated itself from the <i>strict</i> contrapuntal
chain which bound it to the organ, until, in
the sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven, it emerged into
a new life.</p>

<p>Here it was strengthened by the <i>free</i> contrapuntal
treatment it received, like the fruits of early education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
showing themselves in new and original forms,&mdash;speaking
a language founded indeed on the past, but new,
fresh, and sparkling; or, when adopting the strict
style, taking it up as a matter of choice, but not of
compulsion. Such results followed the invention of the
harpsichord,&mdash;the early piano,&mdash;and here we must leave
it. It would, however, be an interesting subject to trace
this development down to Chopin, Liszt, and the modern
Titans of the piano, showing how gradually the mutual
treatment of piano and organ disappeared and what
was substituted in their place. It could, however, only
be satisfactorily done by musical examples.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the orchestra blossomed into a new
significance. To us moderns who read its history, or
look back into the scores which antedate this time, it
does not seem so much a period to be described, as that
of progress, as that of a veritable new birth itself, a new
creation. And this is, indeed, the fact; for no improvements
in ancient instruments, although they took place,
nor addition of new ones, can account for the change
which now occurred in the orchestra. Here it was
<i>the man</i>, not the instrument; and the name of Joseph
Haydn will always be quoted as "Father of the Modern
Orchestra."</p>

<p>The organ lost nothing of real value to itself by this
increased significance of other branches of instrumental
music. Its sphere became defined, and in Germany
quite limited, as to this day it is but rarely employed
there in the way of accompaniment beyond supporting
the choral song of the congregation. In France and
England it has been different, the organ having been
employed to accompany many anthems and other
extended pieces of music, which in Germany (at least
in the larger cities) would be given with the orchestra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
It should be noticed that to England we owe one great
improvement, which, especially for the <i>rôle</i> the organ
is called upon to fill in this country, can scarcely be
overrated. I refer to the invention of the swell, and
the great variety of effects we are enabled to achieve by
its means in both accompaniment and solo playing.</p>

<h2>SECTION III.</h2>


<p>In the London "Spectator" of Feb. 8, 1712, is the
following announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas, Mr. Abraham Jordan, senior and junior,
have, with their own hands, joynery excepted, made
and erected a very large organ in St. Magnus' church,
at the foot of London bridge, consisting of four sets of
keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting the
sounds by swelling the notes, <i>which was never in any
organ before</i>; this instrument will be publicly opened
on Sunday next, the performance by Mr. John
Robinson. The above said Abraham Jordan gives
notice to all masters and performers, that he will
attend every day next week at the said church, to
accommodate all those gentlemen who shall have a
curiosity to hear it."</p>

<p>Very little is known of this Mr. Jordan, except that
his invention pleased greatly, and was found of such
practical use, that not only were all new organs in
England (virtually from this date) furnished with swells,
but himself and son found much occupation in adapting
and adding their invention to the older London organs.
The lack of a swell is the weakest point of the great
majority of German organs. Even Dr. Burney, fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
years after swells had become common in England, expresses,
in his famous work entitled <i>The Present
State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United
Provinces</i>, two volumes, also <i>The Present State of
Music in France and Italy</i>, his great surprise to find
them utterly unknown upon the Continent. His remarks
would hold true at the present day with but
little modification, as far as Germany is concerned, few
instruments outside the larger ones of recent date possessing
this great improvement. The reason of this is to
be found, partly in the extremely conservative character
of their organ-builders, almost a national trait, and
still more in the fact that but little use would be found
for a swell organ outside solo playing. With us, nearly
the reverse is true, the swell being most indispensable in
accompanying choirs as here constituted. Notwithstanding
this neglect of what seems to us an indispensable
addition to the instrument, the glory of the invention
and perfection of the organ justly belongs to
Germany. Modern organ-building requires the most
profound study of the laws both of mechanics and
acoustics, and the German mind was constitutionally
fitted, by a natural depth and thoroughness of thought,
together with the truly artistic quality of patience, to
be successful in solving this great problem,&mdash;the
creation of the most complex instrument known.</p>

<p>France, too, has produced her great organs and
organ-builders. If often lacking the sublimity and
solidity of tone characteristic of many of the famous
German organs, they interest (particularly the American
taste) by a greater variety of the so-called "fancy," or
solo stops. This difference, too, has grown out of the
nature of the duties demanded of the organ and the
organist in the service of the Roman Catholic church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and it is these differences of usage which in process of
time, combining with further differences of national
taste, led to that varied style and treatment which we
denominate "Schools of Playing."</p>

<p>We divide these schools into the German, French,
and English.</p>

<p>The first of these, the German school, is especially
characterized by the importance given to the use of the
pedals, the feet being called upon to execute passages
of equal melodic value with that assigned to the fingers.
This renders it the school of schools for those who
would really attain a mastery of the instrument, and
gain that independence of foot and finger so difficult to
acquire. In fact, it is only possible by a thorough
study of the great masters in this school of playing, to
destroy that sympathy which exists between the left
hand and the feet. This sympathy lies in the fact that
should a pedal passage <i>ascending</i> occur in conjunction
with a left-hand passage <i>descending</i>, the natural inclination
of the left hand is to follow the pedal, instead
of executing its own independent part. Of course the
same trouble is experienced if the conditions, as just
stated, should be reversed. This is the great difficulty
of the <i>obbligato</i>, or independent mode of treating the
pedals, to conquer which may fairly be termed a life-study.
For this reason the earnest student should
always begin his studies in this school, and not deviate
therefrom until such time as a reasonable degree of
skill has been attained, and the sympathy between
hands and feet, before alluded to, measurably overcome.
And here let me say that far too many of those who
feel themselves drawn towards the study of the organ,
approach such study unprepared. The organ, as a
keyed instrument, has all the main points of technique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in common with the piano. All the varied forms of
scales, arpeggios, &amp;c., together with the necessary
independence of finger requisite to play in the <i>legato</i>
style, should first be learned upon the piano, where,
by the way, it can be more speedily acquired. Pupils
who, having accomplished this, proceed to the study of
the organ, can at once begin with the peculiarities and
characteristic difficulties of the instrument, and as far
as the pedal is concerned, will make far more rapid
progress if fair manual players. They are thus enabled
to concentrate their attention upon that which is new
and strange to them. Such would undoubtedly be the
testimony of all those who have had experience in this
branch of teaching.</p>

<p>Without questioning the pre-eminence of the German
school in all matters of technique and pure science,
although educated in that school myself, I would not
claim for it, as do some, that it is the Alpha and
Omega of all true organ playing. Viewed in relation
to the modern organ as it exists to-day, especially
in France, England, and America, it seems to
me that the instrument is in advance of the school,
or that the school is weak in the two following
points:&mdash;</p>

<p>First: It does not make a sufficient employ of
registration within the limits of one and the same
composition. Beauties of contrast, to be obtained by
this means, are too frequently regarded as a matter of
less than secondary importance. This, I am aware,
arises from the fact that the majority of German
organs are incapable of producing such variety, being
built with a single eye to accompanying the congregation.
In the direction of the grand and sublime,
this school is unequalled; but surely there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
effects possible to-day which lay no claim to profundity,
and yet are pleasing and worthy of employment by a
true artist.</p>

<p>Second: Ignoring the emotional element in organ
music to a great extent, and substituting the purely
intellectual and technical. In their melodies we recognize
the true inspiration of the great composers. The
scientific setting they may give them, the technical
dress in which they may clothe them, thus often greatly
enhancing their beauty, is, after all, a matter of pure
science acquired through schooling and dignified by
talent. This appeals to the intellect, and is a most
desirable object of study; but the melodic inspiration
itself appeals to the heart, and, as the God-given
quality, is the higher of the two. Now the German
writers for the organ, from Bach to this day, have, as a
rule (to which I am aware there are some marked
exceptions), apparently avoiding giving to the organ
that <i>melodious</i> element which their great composers
have so beautifully done, not only in their symphonic
writings, but also in their smallest works for the piano
or other instruments. The mere lack of means for
expression (by means of the swell or other mechanical
appliances) is hardly a sufficient explanation of this,
nor do I see anything in the character of the organ to
account for it. That the great German writers following
Bach (Mendelssohn excepted), but more especially
the masters of the more recent so-called Romantic
School, have contributed little or nothing towards
the literature of the organ, is really explained by
the following remark of Berlioz, in his treatise on
"Modern Instrumentation." Speaking of writing
properly for the organ, he says: "The special resources
are here so vast and numerous, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
composer will never be well acquainted with them,
as it appears to me, unless he be himself an accomplished
organist."</p>

<p>The French school of organ playing is usually light,
sensational, often pleasing, but too often frivolous and
unworthy of the instrument. Yet in a certain direction
they have had their great men. No one who has
had the opportunity of hearing Lefebure Wely extemporize
on that great organ at the church of Saint
Sulpice, in Paris, but must acknowledge that the performance
was masterly, although widely different from
the German school. In fact, these extempore performances
of Wely's were far better than his published
compositions. The prevailing tone of the French organ-playing
is dramatic, and, as before said, too often sensational.
As might be expected from the national
character, it forms a great contrast to the German
style. The use of the pedal for melodic phrases is rare,
it being more generally employed simply to give the
fundamental support of the harmonies and passages
executed upon the manuals. On the other hand, much
attention is paid to registration, and frequently much
talent displayed in this direction; besides, their organs
are built in a manner calculated to assist the player
in this respect. Of course the Romish ceremonial, the
universally dominant religion in France, gives much
opportunity for display of this kind. To judge any
of these varieties of organ-playing, it will be seen that
the standpoint of use to which the instrument is to be
put must be carefully borne in mind. Although this
school is by no means devoid of excellencies, it is not
to be recommended to the American student who is
seeking a solid foundation in organ-playing. Still it
may be employed to advantage, both in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
recreation, general culture, and especially as studies
in registration, after the "weightier matters of the
law" have received due attention.</p>

<p>The English school, as a <i>distinctive</i> method of treatment,
can hardly be said to exist. It forms a sort
of middle ground between the two schools of which I
have just spoken, and their organs may be described in
the same manner as to characteristics of building. In
America, of late years, we have followed suit, copying
Germany in the voicing of most of our open and
stopped pipes, both metal and wood; copying France
in the main characteristics of their reed voicing (in
which they were long pre-eminent), and copying England
in the general plan of our organs, together
with their conveniences of mechanism and effects of
combination.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact, then, that England has no distinctive
<i>national</i> school of the instrument, still there
is probably no country where so much interest is taken
in organs and organ-playing as in the England of to-day.
Her prominent organists are solidly founded on
the German school; but while they execute these great
works in a masterly manner, their <i>repertoire</i> extends
over a far wider range and variety of compositions
than the German school alone can supply. This seems
to me to be praiseworthy, for although the practice of
this theory may be carried too far, and it is certain
that <i>everything</i> cannot even approximately be played
upon the organ; yet, in view of the vast improvements
of the last twenty years, all tending to assist the
players in producing effects impossible heretofore, why
should the use of these means be ignored? The English
organists, to this end, have made a vast number
of arrangements and adaptations from works not ori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ginally
composed for the organ. Very many of these
are just as effective as if originally composed for the
instrument, and so far form a welcome addition to
organ literature; inasmuch as they generally embody
the use of the new improvements and facilities referred
to. On the other hand, many of these go too far, and
attempt transcriptions of compositions totally opposed
to the genius of the organ. The careful student will,
however, easily be able to recognize and avoid such, if
he has had the proper foundation laid before attempting
works of this class.</p>

<p>There are those, however (and their opinions are entitled
to respect), who claim that such free treatment
of the organ is improper. These persons would, with
little or no exception, limit the <i>repertoire</i> to such works
as have been originally written for the organ; and
when they got outside fugue or canon, would still
remain carefully within the limits of purely contrapuntal
orthodoxy. Any other treatment is styled "<i>illegitimate</i>."
I had hoped to avoid this terrible word,&mdash;the
great bugbear among conscientious students of the
organ,&mdash;nor do I propose to enter into any analysis of
what the "legitimate" may or may not consist in. The
fact is, we should all retain our original opinions very
much according to our early education, natural tastes,
and impressions. There has been much controversy on
this point, and I do not think it necessary to contribute
to that. In any case, where the subject under discussion
cannot be considered as a <i>positive</i> right or
wrong, but largely as a matter of taste or preference,
there will always be a difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Froude, the historian, says in one of his published
lectures: "Controversy has kept alive a certain quantity
of bitterness; and that, I suspect, is all that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
would accomplish if continued till the day of judgment....
Each polemic writes for his <i>own partisans</i>, and
makes no impression on his adversary." So it would
be in this case.</p>

<p>The inference which I draw from this superficial
glance at the main characteristics of these three schools,
is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The American student who would excel as an organist,
must first be thoroughly educated in the
German school of playing. Here alone can he gain
the solid technique which will fit him for the execution
of any tasks he may propose to himself. Only from
that mine of musical wealth, the German school, especially
as represented by Bach, can the suitable foundation-stones
for the desired structure be derived. But
with this foundation broadly and deeply laid, as the
building progresses upward, the best of architects may,
without fear, add many things that simply please the
eye, but bear no relation whatever to the strength or
durability of the edifice. So with the education of the
organ student; first the broad foundation, and then a
judicious liberalism. His auditors will always remain
the great public, and that public to the end of time
will never be so versed in musical science that it can
appreciate the stricter forms of organ music. But very
many among the public <i>can</i> appreciate, or at least
enjoy; and this number is increasing from year to
year. I am by no means arguing that the organist
should avoid these stricter forms on this account; quite
the contrary; but simply that the judicious liberalism
above referred to should provide as great a variety of
musical food as will suit and satisfy the musical
appetite within the means of the instrument as it now
exists. Nor should the "milk for babes" be despised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The workings of this principle will surely attract rather
than repel, and maturer musical strength will instinctively
call for heartier food. We have to deal
with men as we find them, and tastes vary. A programme
intended for a miscellaneous audience is, after
all, only a musical bill of fare. Real musical hunger
can only be satisfied with solids; but if we first quiet
the deeper cravings with roast beef, I know of no moral
obligation why we should not finish with ice-cream, if
inclination should point that way. To invert the order
would be manifestly unsound.</p>

<p>To my mind, then, the duty of the American organist
of to-day is to be eclectic. He has no "call" to tie
himself up exclusively and strictly to any one particular
school; nor, if he pursues the right course, need his
education, technical or æsthetic, suffer on this account.
But he must justify this argument by being thorough
in what he undertakes. The skill with which a thing
is done goes far to justify it, if there is any question at
all about the matter. Not that I suppose that many
can be found, who, with all talent and due diligence,
can equally excel in all styles; still the effect of liberalism
in this respect cannot but have a good effect
upon the general culture, and aid not a little towards
the accomplishment of that great problem, professional
success.</p>

<p>I cannot close without a congratulatory word respecting
the standing, present and prospective, of the
profession in America to-day. I am proud that we
begin to be able to point to so many musicians (even if
the number is still relatively few) who, both from their
own scientific standpoint, and from that of general
culture, are deemed worthy of being placed side by side
with the other learned professions. Is not the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of this college as a branch of a university course,
proof of this comparatively new but happily increasing
appreciation? Of what importance, then, to keep this
present status intact, to secure it, to increase it, by
upholding the dignity of our profession! Let such as
propose to devote their lives to it, both feel and practise

<blockquote><p>The value of the study of Wagner's prose writing as an education to
the musical student cannot be over-estimated, and amongst these
prose writings "Opera and Drama" may be considered his principal
critical and theoretical production. Without a study of its
contents no true and lasting understanding of opera can be arrived
at.</p>

<p>ERNEST NEWMAN in "A Study of Wagner," writes: "Although there
appears here and there in his prose-work something of the vast
synthetic power of his musical imagination&mdash;such a work as 'Opera
and Drama,' for instance, finally compelling our admiration for its
tenacity of purpose and the breadth of vision that sweeps so far
before and after."</p></blockquote>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
